# GuessTheNumber

This was created as a fun practice to learning Python on my own, and because I love simple games that can be played repeatedly without having to use the noggin a lot!

I'd definitely like more inputs on how the game can be improved, and in turn, develop my skills in Python to a much greater extent! Therefore, #FeelFreeToFork!

Python Version: 2.7.1.0

Program Used: Python's IDLE
